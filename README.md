 * PretorioDivisio Paintball TIMETAG for Capture the Flag + Search and Destroy
 * (C) Maximilian Tuftner 2021 (Wirbelwind)
 * Firmware Version 2.0
 * FW2.0 uses the 16-Bit Timer1 for exactly generating 1 s. +/- (<1ms) 
   instead of delay(), millis() or micros() which would block some features and functions.
 * If you have any questions or maybe improvements please contact me on:
